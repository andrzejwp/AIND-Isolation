\title{AIND Isolation game playing agent report}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
The task was to implement an agent playing the Isolation game, using Minimax with
alpha-beta pruning and iterative deepening. The agent would use one of 3 heuristics
for assesing current board state during termination of each search. Termination
happens either when end-game is reached or when the search reaches specified depth.

The heuristic implemented were:
\begin{itemize}
  \item AB\_Custom - For first 5 moves - use the distance from center heuristic, Later in the game - use the number of my moves - number of opponent moves
  \item AB\_Custom\_2 - For first 40 moves - use distance between opponent's pieces, later in the game - use the square of number of available moves
  \item AB\_Custom\_3 - For first 3 moves - assign High score for center move, later assign higher points to locations near the center, finally use square of number of available moves
\end{itemize}

I examined the results of 20 runs of the tournament.py script (shown in Figure \ref{fig-tab-tournament-results})
and ran simple statistical analysis, as shown in Figure \ref{fig-code-ttest}.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\begin{minted}{python}
print("h0 is that AB_Improved has the same performance as AB_Custom")

[stat,pvalue] = stats.ttest_ind(df['AB_Improved'], df['AB_Custom'], 0)
if(pvalue < 0.05):
    print('h0 rejected - AB_Improved does not have the same performance as AB_Custom')
else:
    print('h0 accepted - AB_Improved does have the same performance as AB_Custom')

print("h0 is that AB_Improved has the same performance as AB_Custom_2")

[stat,pvalue] = stats.ttest_ind(df['AB_Improved'], df['AB_Custom_2'], 0)
if(pvalue < 0.05):
    print('h0 rejected - AB_Improved does not have the same performance as AB_Custom_2')
else:
    print('h0 accepted - AB_Improved does have the same performance as AB_Custom_2')

print("h0 is that AB_Improved has the same performance as AB_Custom_3")

[stat,pvalue] = stats.ttest_ind(df['AB_Improved'], df['AB_Custom_3'], 0)
if(pvalue < 0.05):
    print('h0 rejected - AB_Improved does not have the same performance as AB_Custom_3')
else:
    print('h0 accepted - AB_Improved does have the same performance as AB_Custom_3')
\end{minted}

\label{fig-code-ttest}
\end{figure}

The result of the analysis (as seen in Figure \ref{fig-code-ttest-results}) confirms
that AB\_Custom\_3 is far worse than AB\_Improved, as well as that AB\_Custom and
AB\_Custom\_2 are not statistically different from AB\_Improved.

\begin{figure}

  \begin{minted}{python}
    h0 is that AB_Improved has the same performance as AB_Custom
    h0 accepted - AB_Improved does have the same performance as AB_Custom
    h0 is that AB_Improved has the same performance as AB_Custom_2
    h0 accepted - AB_Improved does have the same performance as AB_Custom_2
    h0 is that AB_Improved has the same performance as AB_Custom_3
    h0 rejected - AB_Improved does not have the same performance as AB_Custom_3
